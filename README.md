# Logistic-Regression-Case-Study
Initially, logistic regression was trained without class weights and ignored the minority class, giving misleading accuracy. After using 'class_weight = 'balanced' and 'max_iter = 1000', the model learnt both classes properly, improving fairness and prediction reliability.
