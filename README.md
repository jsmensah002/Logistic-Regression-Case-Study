Results from not using class weight and max_iter:
R^2 (full dataset) = 0.9377
R^2 (Trained 80% of the data) = 0.93717
R^2 (Tested 20% of the data) = 0.93962

Results from using class weight and max_iter:
R^2 (full dataset) = 0.4216
R^2 (Trained 80% of the data) = 0.4232
R^2 (Tested 20% of the data) = 0.4123

Key Insights: From this case study, it can be concluded that replacing null values with the median has a slightly higher model performance than the mean.
